# Hello, World! in Go

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating a basic "Hello, World!" program in the Go programming language.

## Step 1: Set up your Go environment

Before you start, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). Follow the installation instructions provided.

## Step 2: Create a new Go file

Open your favorite text editor and create a new file named `hello.go`. The `.go` extension indicates that this is a Go source code file.

## Step 3: Write the "Hello, World!" program

Inside `hello.go`, enter the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
